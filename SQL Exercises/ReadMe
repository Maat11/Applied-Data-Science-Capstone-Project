In this folder you can find the exercises I solved using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

I used the AdventureWorks sample database recommended by https://learn.microsoft.com, which you can find here https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks

I solved the exercises from here:
