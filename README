This repository contains my notes and practice exercises of DS Tools.
The scope of this repository is to keep potential employers updated on my progress, until I get my first job as a Junior Data Analyst, or a position related to this role.
If the reader of this file is instead a newbie like me, please reffer to the links of the recources attached in the ReadMe files (which you can find in each folder of this repository), so you can practice by yourself.

Best regards,
Bianca Diana È˜malbelgher
