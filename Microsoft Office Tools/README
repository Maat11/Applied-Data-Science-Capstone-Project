I used:

- the free version of Microsoft Office 365 
      - Excel to solve 
            - 'xlookup exercises'
            - 'w3schools.com_excel'
            - 'Pivot-Table-Exercise'
            - 'pokemon'
            - 'DataCleaning_(AlexTheAnalystFreeTraining)'
            - 'ExcelProject_(AlexTheAnalystFreeTraining)'
      - PowerPoint to create
            - 'ProcurementPresentation'
            - 'SpendAnalysis_Presentation'

- PowerBI to solve 'PowerBI_BiancaPractice_GharaniTutorial' file
- Microsoft Office 2010 to exercise creating Macros (and comments), for the 'Macros-START' file

I have chosen to continue with PowerBI because I can't use PowerQuery in Microsoft Office 2010 due to an error I get when I try to install it, and the free version of 365 does not have PowerQuery
- 'Start-Power-Bi-Essentials-Dataset' (I only cleaned the data, because the rest of the tutorial was beyond my scope at the moment)
- 'm01_cleaned'
- 'PopulationByCity&Year'
- 'fromFolderCSV'
