I used:

- the free version of Microsoft Office 365 
      - Excel to solve 'xlookup exercises', 'w3schools.com_excel', 'Pivot-Table-Exercise', 'pokemon', 'DataCleaning_(AlexTheAnalystFreeTraining)', and 'ExcelProject_(AlexTheAnalystFreeTraining)' files
      - PowerPoint to create 'ProcurementPresentation' and 'SpendAnalysis_Presentation' files

- PowerBI to solve 'PowerBI_BiancaPractice_GharaniTutorial' file
- Microsoft Office 2010 to exercise creating Macros (and comments), for the 'Macros-START' file

I have chosen to continue with PowerBI because I can't use PowerQuery in Microsoft Office 2010 due to an error I get when I try to install it (the Add-In Power Query to Excel 2010)
- PowerBI to solve 'Start-Power-Bi-Essentials-Dataset' file. I only cleaned the data, because the rest of the tutorial was beyond my scope at the moment
- PowerBI to clean the data in 'm01_cleaned'
