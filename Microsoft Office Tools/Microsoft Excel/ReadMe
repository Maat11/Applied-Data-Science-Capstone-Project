I used:

- the free version of Microsoft Office 365 Excel to solve 
  - 'xlookup exercises'
  - 'w3schools.com_excel'
  - 'Pivot-Table-Exercise'
  - 'pokemon'
  - 'DataCleaning_(AlexTheAnalystFreeTraining)'
  - 'ExcelProject_(AlexTheAnalystFreeTraining)'

- Microsoft Office 2010 to exercise creating Macros (and comments), for the 'Macros-START' file

I have chosen to practice Power Queries in PowerBI because I can't use PowerQuery in Microsoft Office 2010 due to an error I get when I try to install it, and the free version of 365 does not have PowerQuery.
