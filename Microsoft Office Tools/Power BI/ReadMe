I used the free version of PowerBI to solve:

- 'PowerBI_BiancaPractice_GharaniTutorial'
- 'Start-Power-Bi-Essentials-Dataset' (I only cleaned the data, because the rest of the tutorial was beyond my scope at the moment)
- 'm01_cleaned'
- 'PopulationByCity&Year'
- 'fromFolderCSV'
- 'FemaleStudentsWith3&moreCredits'
